# GETFITT - A Healthy Life during Lockdown.  
#### During the COVID worldwide lockdown from 2019 to 2020, we are all forced to stay at home, unable to work, socialise, exercise, or visit our loved ones. As a result, many people struggle to stay physically and psychologically fit. A popular approach that helps people cope is maintaining a daily workout routine which will keep their mind and body in shape.
#### Therefore, the purpose of this application is to help workout-er organise, plan, and carry out daily workouts with visual exercise guidance. Users can also track their biometric data (BMI, BMR, and weight) to ensure they always maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
